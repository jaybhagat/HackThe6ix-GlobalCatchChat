# Catch! (Around the World) chat feature

## Our Inspiration

The chat feature of Catch! was developed to create an even more personal experience with the person you're playig with, while socially distancing!

## What it does

Our application uses AR and Unity to allow you to play catch with another person from somewhere else in the globe! You can tap a button which allows you to throw a ball off into space, and then the person you send the ball to will be able to catch it and throw it back. We also allow users to chat with one another using our web-based chatting application so they can have some comentary going on while they are playing catch.

## How we built it

The chat feature is built using Flask, Socket.io and HTML. We used Socket.io to create bi-directional communication with the server.
